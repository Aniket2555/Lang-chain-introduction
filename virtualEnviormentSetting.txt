You're encountering a PowerShell execution policy restriction. PowerShell prevents running scripts by default for security reasons. To fix this, you need to change the execution policy. Follow these steps:

### **Solution: Change Execution Policy**
1. **Open PowerShell as Administrator:**
   - Press `Win + X` and select **PowerShell (Admin)** or **Terminal (Admin)**.

2. **Check the Current Execution Policy:**
   ```powershell
   Get-ExecutionPolicy
   ```
   If it returns **Restricted**, that means scripts cannot be executed.

3. **Temporarily Allow Scripts for This Session:**
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy Unrestricted -Scope Process
   ```
   - This will allow you to activate the virtual environment **only for this session**.
   - If you close PowerShell, it will revert to the original setting.

4. **(Optional) Permanently Change Execution Policy:**
   If you want a more permanent solution, set it to **RemoteSigned**:
   ```powershell
   Set-ExecutionPolicy RemoteSigned -Scope CurrentUser
   ```
   - This allows locally created scripts to run but blocks downloaded scripts unless signed.

5. **Activate the Virtual Environment Again:**
   ```powershell
   venv\Scripts\Activate
   ```
